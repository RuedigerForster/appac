## Overview

APPAC is a versatile software package designed to improve measurement accuracy. Initially developed for atmospheric pressure peak area correction in gas chromatography, it can also be widely applied to other environmental sensor data. By addressing environmental influences, instrumental bias, and non-linear responses, APPAC provides customized solutions to stabilize and enhance data accuracy across various applications. In addition to outputting correction models, it generates time-based drift factors to effectively mitigate errors caused by baseline shifts, drift, and environmental factors, ensuring accurate and reliable measurements.
